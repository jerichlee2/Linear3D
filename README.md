# Linear3D.py

A program to visualize tensor transformations in Solid Mechanics. This program uses ManimGL, a library by 3B1B and template code from ZeroBone.

Check out https://github.com/3b1b/manim for info on setup. Check out https://zerobone.net/blog/cs/linear-transformations-3d-manim/ for more information. His code was outdated with Grant's continously changing library, so this program is just an updated version of ZeroBone's. May need to be changed again in the future.
